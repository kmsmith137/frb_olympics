## v4

  - Another overhaul, remove dependence on "heavyweight" CHIME libraries such as rf_pipelines,
    now aiming to make the frb_olympics a self-contained tool that could be used for a code challenge.

## v3

  - Major gutting, almost all code moved elsewhere (simpulse, rf_pipelines, bonsai, sloth).

  - Backwards incompatible changes to file formats.

## v2

  - Hybrid C++/python version

## v1

  - Primordial pure-C++ version

## frb_olympics

There used to be a lot of code here, but all functionality was moved to other repositories:
   - simpulse (https://github.com/kmsmith137/simpulse)
   - rf_pipelines (https://github.com/kmsmith137/rf_pipelines)
   - bonsai (https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/bonsai)
   - sloth (https://github.com/kmsmith137/sloth)

All that's left is a 500-line python file!
